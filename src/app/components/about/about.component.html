          Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience in Angular, Python, and
          Spring Boot. Specializing in application development, cloud

          I have close to 2 years of experience in the industry and have worked
          on various projects, My latest project being part of my graduation.
          This project was the "Onboarding Experience". A cloud-native web app
          for newcomers to the company where they can find their schedule,
          general information, goals, and contact person. Focusing on end-to-end
          development of the onboarding web application, employing Angular for
          the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend with a Jenkins pipeline
          for the CI/CD and Cloud Foundry for the deployment.
